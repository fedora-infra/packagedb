Mapping of python classes to Database Tables.
'''
### FIXME:  We've broken up the one model file into several different files
# for each piece of data in the model.  We need to update the code that
# references this to get the classes from the separate files.  Then we can get
# rid of these imports

# :W0401: use wildcard imports until we can deprecate this whole file.
# :W0614: Importing these so that we can use them by importing them from
#  pkgdb.model.
# pylint: disable-msg=W0401,W0614
